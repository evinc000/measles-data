# Portfolio Description: Measles Vaccination Data Analysis

This project delves into a detailed dataset that contains vaccination information for schools across the United States. Each entry in the dataset represents a school and includes:
- Overall immunization rates
- Specific MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccination rates
- Metadata such as geographic coordinates and school names

Through data exploration, visualization, and analysis, this project aims to uncover trends and regional disparities in vaccination rates, providing actionable insights into the national vaccination landscape. This showcase demonstrates my data skills and builds my portfolio.

# Original Data Source and Credits

This repository is a fork of the original repository available at [WSJ/measles-data](https://github.com/WSJ/measles-data) and contains immunization rate data for schools across the U.S., as compiled by The Wall Street Journal. The dataset includes the overall and MMR-specific vaccination rates for **46,412** schools in **32** states, as used in [“What’s the Measles Vaccination Rate at Your Child’s School?“](https://www.wsj.com/graphics/school-measles-rate-map/).

Vaccination rates are for the 2017-18 school year for Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, and Washington. Rates for other states are 2018-19.

## Files

Our data is broken down into a few files:
| File  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| all-measles-rates.csv  | Data for each individual school  |
| state-overview.csv  | More generalized data by state counties or state school districts  |
| individual-states/[STATE].csv  | Same data as all-measles-rates, but separated by state  |

## Methodology

The vaccination data was provided by the state health departments. Addresses for about 16,000 schools in eight states were included in the original data. Locations of the remaining schools were determined by checking against the National Center for Education Statistics’ school directories or the states’ school directory using school name, city, county and/or school district. If there was no unique match, the school’s location was determined with Google Maps API using school name, state and county, city and/or school district. Duplicate locations were analyzed individually.
